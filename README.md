[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/FerranMarin/axie-scholar-utilities.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/FerranMarin/axie-scholar-utilities)

This software's intent is to automate all activities related to manage Scholars. It is specially aimed to mangers with large scholar roasters.
As of now it has the following commands:

- Generate Secrets (Helper to generate secrets.json file)
- Mass Generate Secrets (Helper to generate secrets.json file from a csv file, for bulk creation)
- Generate Payout file (Helper to generate payments.json file from a csv file)
- SLP Claim
- Automatic Payouts
- Axie Transfers
- Axie Morphing
- Axie Breeding
- QR Code Generation

To know how to use it, install it, please visit the [wiki](https://ferranmarin.github.io/axie-scholar-utilities/)


# How is this and future developments financed?

There is embedded in the code a 1% fee. I believe this is a fair charge for this automation. It allows me to dedicate time and effort on bettering this software and add more features! Please do not remove it as it is the only way I have to support this project.

There is also a fee for breeding. This one is charged at once and the pricing is as follows. Each breed costs:

| Range          | Price  |
|:-------------- |:------:|
| Until 15       | 30 SLP |
| From 16 to 30  | 25 SLP |
| From 31 to 50  | 20 SLP |
| From 51        | 15 SLP |

So if you want to breed 22 Axies the fee would be:

(15 * 30) + (7 * 25) = 625 SLP

The more you breed at once, the cheaper it gets per axie. Be careful with the max amount of tx per account!
You can breed using multiple accounts and pay the fee with another one. More instructions, in the [wiki](https://ferranmarin.github.io/axie-scholar-utilities/pages/poetry_cmds#axiebreeding),


# Roadmap

- Add capability to payout from accounts with Trezor (needs investigation)
- Release a desktop app (even more convenient)
- Integrate with Discord (via a self-hosted bot, it will be 100% yours!)
- ...
- Feel free to suggest what's next on Discord! :)


Feel free to open issues requesting features. I will consider all of them and maybe add them in the future!
