# F.A.Q.

## How do I get my private keys?

**Please keep these always safe and private!**

You will need to open your ronin wallet extension in Chrome or Firefox. And follow these steps:

## Is it safe to use?

What do you expect me to say? I'd say of course yes, but do not take me at my word.
Please do get your coder/progammer friends to read and check my code. Look for people who has used it already and ask them (hint: a lot are in the <a href="https://discord.gg/bmKvmhenvu">Discord</a>).

And if you still do not trust it, please do not use it.
I want you only using this tool/software if you are comfortable doing so.

## How to update to a newer version?

Depends on the method you use to run the tool. For those of you using the docker-hub image is as simple as pulling it again.
Remember that is done with the following command:

    docker pull epith/axie-scholar-utilities

If you use either poetry or docker-compose you will need to get the new code either by downloading it from the [releases page](https://github.com/FerranMarin/axie-scholar-utilities/releases) or by using the git pull command. Later one, only reserved to those who know how to use git.
Remember for this one to move your files folder from the old unziped code to the new one and re-build the image / re-install dependencies!
